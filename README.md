# QBASIC Project

## 📘 Overview
This project is written in **QBASIC**, a beginner-friendly programming language developed by Microsoft.  
It demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, and basic graphics (if applicable).  

You can use this project as a learning resource or as a foundation for creating your own QBASIC programs.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Simple, easy-to-read QBASIC source code  
- Demonstrates structured programming concepts  
- Compatible with DOS and QB64 (modern QBASIC interpreter)  
- Commented code for clarity and learning  

---

## 💻 Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need one of the following:

- **QBASIC (qbasic.exe)** — runs natively in DOS environments  
- **QB64** — a modern compiler compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux  
  👉 [Download QB64 here](https://www.qb64.dev)

## ⚙️ How to Run

### Using QBASIC (DOS)
1. Copy the `.BAS` file into your QBASIC directory.  
2. Open the command prompt and navigate to that directory.  
3. Type:
   ```bash
   qbasic /run filename.bas
````

### Using QB64 (Recommended)

1. Install **QB64** from [qb64.dev](https://www.qb64.dev).
2. Open QB64 and load your `.BAS` file.
3. Press `F5` to compile and run the program.

## 💬 Notes

* QBASIC is case-insensitive.
* If using QB64, some legacy graphics or sound commands may behave slightly differently.
* Always save your `.BAS` files before running to prevent data loss.
